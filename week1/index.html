    <p>Section tags are basically div tags that have been named something different to help make flow of code easier to read for the developers. <br>
        Saving information to load it later is still a little hard for me to put together I tried doing my own version of this but did not end up getting it all and think I needed more time to understand it <br>
        why do they put the script tag and the style tag directly into the html would it not make things more messy and hard to use when you could put it on another page? <br>
        I ended up just putting a simple text box in the example I found <br>
        I was not able to watch the video because I still had not received my code to get on the site point
