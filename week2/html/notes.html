        <p>
            What i have learned from this weeks readings have been: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>How to interact with an array to see whats in it to see how to add and remove things from it</li>
            <li>I learned about the concat feature which is there to help connect different arrays or even just use the
                3 dots notation</li>
            <li>How to use the join function to turn an array into string and add any kind of way to separate them</li>
            <li>using the length on an array makes more sense to me now on what it does and how you can even make an
                array bigger even if you don't have stuff to fill it</li>
            <li>A switch statement also seems like it can be a great way to simplify a lot of if else statements</li>
            <li>the while loop also looks very useful to take the place of a for loop in some cases would like to know
                when one may be better than another. </li>
            <li>may need more help understanding the rest function?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
