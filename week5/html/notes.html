        <h1>Week 5 Notes</h1>
        <p>
            What I learned from the lesson this week is better ways to debug my code. <br>
            I also learned the good practice of using the strict word so that I can keep my code from being sloppy. <br>
            We then looked at the debugger tools you have available on browsers to better see what is wrong with your
            code. <br>
            Then we moved to using alerts(), console.log(), and debugger to catch issues with your code in different
            spots to better fix it.
